    "# Dataset Generation Template\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a template for generating and uploading new datasets to MLflow, after you have the raw scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data needs to be organized in a dictionary with three required keys:\n",
    "- `inputs`: Feature matrix as NumPy array\n",
    "- `target`: Binary target matrix as NumPy array\n",
    "- `target_names`: List of strings naming each target feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shape Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Type | Shape | Description | Example |\n",
    "|-----------|------|-------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| `inputs` | `np.ndarray` | `(n_samples, n_features)` | Each row is one sample, each column a feature | `(1000, 10)` for 1000 samples with 10 features |\n",
    "| `target` | `np.ndarray` | `(n_samples, n_targets)` | Binary matrix where each column represents one target | `(1000, 3)` for 1000 samples with 3 possible targets |\n",
    "| `target_names` | `list[str]` | `(n_targets,)` | Names for each target column | `[\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bird\"]` for 3 targets |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    \"inputs\": np.array([\n",
    "        [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],  # Sample 1 with 3 features\n",
    "        [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],  # Sample 2 with 3 features\n",
    "        # ... more samples\n",
    "    ]),\n",
    "    \"target\": np.array([\n",
    "        [1, 0],  # Sample 1: positive for target 1, negative for target 2\n",
    "        [0, 1],  # Sample 2: negative for target 1, positive for target 2\n",
    "        # ... more samples\n",
    "    ]),\n",
    "    \"target_names\": [\"group_A\", \"group_B\"]  # Names for the two target columns\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uploading the dataset\n",
    "Once your data is prepared, use `upload_dataset()` to save it to MLflow.\n",
    "This will verify that the data is formatted correctly and then upload it to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "upload_dataset(\n",
    "    data=data,\n",
    "    dataset_name=\"ftir_no_bonding_effects\",  # Broader dataest for which we can have multiple versions\n",
    "    version_name=\"initial_data\",  # Description of this version\n",
    "    description=\"FTIR dataset downloaded from the FCGFormer paper without any modifications\"  # Optional details\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After upload, the dataset will be available in MLflow for model training with:\n",
    "- NumPy arrays saved as `.npy` files\n",
    "- Target names and counts (number of positive examples) in text files\n",
    "- The code of this notebook saved for reproducability (so you don't have to upload it anywhere)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view your dataset in MLflow by opening the link printed after calling `upload_dataset()`."
